# Math-Sharp | NOT READY

## Basic
It will be a simple, usable, open-source C-Sharp libary containing math stuffs. I know C-Sharp already have math commands, but they are not enough proper.

## Download | Open-Source
There are a several things you should do for full access. First of all you have to create a new file called: "MathSharp.cs" in your project. Then copy-paste the code into this file. Now the only thing what you have to do, is to type: "using MathSharp;" in the file where Math-Sharp is needed. Make sure this command is at the beginning of the file, otherwise it will not work.

## Download | .dll
I created a folder called. "bin". There is a file called: "MathSharp.dll". You just simply download it and put it inside your project folder. The only thing I want to mention is, that you cannot edit the code anymore.
